Alrighty mates! We've reached the harbor!

However, to end this voyage, we need to say goodbye to your box for a while. Do not worry! You will meet her again once you make your own Sail instance in your own machine.

To destroy your Sail box, run:

`sail rm https://github.com/cdr/sshcode`{{execute}}

and it should remove all traces of the `sshcode` box, change the URL to something else if you used another repo.
