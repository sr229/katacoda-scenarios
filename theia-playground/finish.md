Thank you for using the playground.

As always, if you find any errors regarding the playground, please open an [issue](https://github.com/sr229/katacoda-scenarios/issues/new).

If you like Theia, I also recommend [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io), which is hosted Theia for GitHub projects. Theia is free for Open Source projects.

See you again!
