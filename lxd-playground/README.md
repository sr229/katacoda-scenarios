# LXD Playground

This is a playground intended for learning Linux Containers (LXC). A precursor of Docker and what Docker used to use before making its own runtime, named `containerd`.


## What to expect

For now, you can't actually browse inside the container if you have a running service there. But you can check their liveliness by using `wget` in spider mode.
