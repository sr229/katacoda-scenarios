Now we made the container, now we need to go inside the container.

To do that simply run this:

`lxc exec killercoda -- /bin/bash`{{execute}}

`exec` might be familiar for you in Docker, you also see that the container's name (`killercoda`) is after exec. This is some new syntax that is not the same as Docker's.

if you see the CLI change, that means you're in!

when you're done playing around, exit the container, and discover something else.
