Now we made the container, now we need to go inside the container.

To do that simply run this:

`lxc exec killercoda -- /bin/bash`{{execute}}

`exec` might be familiar for you in Docker, the difference is that you provide which instance to run the command to after providing what to run.

if you see the CLI change, that means you're in!

when you're done playing around, exit the container, and discover something else.
