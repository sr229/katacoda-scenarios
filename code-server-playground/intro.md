Welcome to the code-server playground!

code-server is a distribution of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for Web, originally one of the only ways to run VSCode in the browser. Nowadays, it shares a weird spot with VSCode itself, GitHub Codespaces, and Gitpod's own distribution.

Go ahead and have fun with the playground, if you find something off, let the author know at [GitHub](https://github.com/sr229/katacoda-scenarios).


Happy coding!
