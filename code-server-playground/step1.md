Go ahead and browse the IDE at port `3000` at the terminal.

We use ubuntu for this environment, so if you want to install something, for example, `build-essential`,
do it like this:


`sudo apt install build-essential`{{execute}}

If you find any errors regarding the playground, please open an [issue](https://github.com/sr229/katacoda-scenarios/issues/new).

If you find any issues with `code-server`, let the developers know at the [project repository](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/issues/new).


Happy coding~!
